# CUSTOM U-NET FOR WEAPON DETECTION


## Description

This project is based on creating a network for gun segmentation in images. To accomplish this, a version of U-net is 
developed, where the encoding part will be a ResNet18 with ImageNet weights. For the decoding part, information from 
this network will be leveraged, and using an inversion strategy, the architecture will be replicated, with weights 
initialized by reversing their order.
